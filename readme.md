# Data Visualization with Python project

This repository contains Python code for analyzing a dataset related to online courses. The analysis explores relationships between different course attributes and provides insights into enrollment, ratings, difficulty levels, and certificate types.

## Overview

The analysis is organized into several sections:

1. **Importing Libraries and Data:** Loading necessary libraries and the dataset, providing a brief overview of the dataset's columns and purpose.
   
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Preprocessing steps to clean the data, handle missing values, and transform columns for analysis.
   
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploring different columns through statistical summaries, visualizations, and insights.
   
4. **Relationship Between Variables:** Investigating correlations between numerical variables and conducting ANOVA and Tukey's HSD tests for categorical vs. numerical variables.
   
5. **Conclusions and Suggestions:** Summarizing findings, conclusions drawn from the analysis, and suggestions for further improvements.

## Contents

- `course_data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis.
- `coursea_data.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.

## Usage

1. Ensure Python and necessary libraries are installed.
2. Open `course_data_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Execute each cell to run the analysis step-by-step.
4. Follow the comments and markdown cells for explanations and insights.

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Enhance the analysis by incorporating additional variables or more advanced statistical techniques.
- Consider adding interactive visualizations for a more engaging exploration experience.
- Improve code readability by maintaining consistent naming conventions and adding function documentation.
