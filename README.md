# Spotify Top Tracks Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing a dataset of Spotify's top 50 tracks. The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and provides insights into the features of the tracks and their popularity.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and treating outliers. In this dataset, there are no missing values, and no duplicates were found. Outliers in specific columns are capped at the lower and upper percentiles.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis section provides basic statistics and answers various questions about the dataset. Some of the questions addressed include:

- Number of observations and features in the dataset.
- Identification of categorical and numeric features.
- Artists and albums with more than one popular track.
- The most popular artist and genre.
- Correlation analysis between features.
- Comparison of danceability, loudness, and acousticness scores between different music genres.

## How to Improve the Analysis

To improve this analysis, consider the following suggestions:

1. Perform statistical tests to identify and handle outliers more rigorously.
2. Conduct statistical tests to determine if the differences between music genres are statistically significant.
3. Incorporate data from different time periods (e.g., years or months) to enhance the dataset's diversity and reliability.
4. Use additional visualizations to present findings more effectively.

Feel free to customize and enhance the analysis further based on your specific requirements.
